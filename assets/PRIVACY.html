    Information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered
    Personal Data or Personal Information by relevant law or regulation, we will also treat these identifiers as

    activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services and user experience.
  </p>
  <h2>3. HOW WE MAY USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>

    into the XpertFit app;
    &nbsp;
    <br/>

    applies to cases when you (as an end-user) receive a link to XpretFit from a third party, who is 3DLOOK’s client or
    user (e.g., when you’re receiving a link from a uniform apparel distributor, who, after the completion of the
    virtual sizing process, helps you to order the garments you’ve selected). When you access and continue to use
    XpertFit via such third-party sites, products, services, and/or via links from a third party, who is 3DLOOK’s
    client, you agree to a data transfer to such third party.

    individual with Personal Information or Personal Data, the combined information will be treated as Personal
    Information or Personal Data for as long as it remains combined.
  </p>
  <p>

    Information

    essential part of how the services work (to the extent permitted under relevant law or regulation).
  </p>
  <h2>4. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>
    3DLOOK will not pass your Personal Data and/or Personal Information to third parties, except for when it is required
    by functions of the XpertFit app and its features, and in that case, the privacy of data transmitted is guaranteed
    by those third parties; if you access the XpertFit app via third-party sites, links, products, or services, we may
    provide information on your body parameters to such third-parties for the aim of the provision of such third-party
    services to you. For example, in case if you get access to XpertFit via a link from a uniform apparel distributor,
    who, after the completion of the virtual sizing process, helps you to order the garments you’ve selected, we will
    provide information on your body parameters to such third-party for the aim of the provision of such third-party
    services to you. This also applies to cases described in Section 3 [HOW WE MAY USE YOUR INFORMATION] above.

    perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include, but are not limited to: data storage
    services, database maintenance services, mailing. When we use such third parties to perform services on our behalf,

    information that is collected and the purpose for which it is collected, bearing in mind the requirements applicable
    to the situation and the need to destroy outdated, unused Information at the earliest reasonable time. In general,
    we store your Personal Data for up to 3 years and revise it after that period. During such revision, we may either
    delete all of your Personal Data or keep it collected for the additional 10 years if: we are providing the services
    to you; you’re using the XpertFit app; we are in the middle of a dispute, or you are our debtor; such information is
    still necessary for the purposes we collected it. We can delete your Personal Data or Personal Information at any
    time and not wait for such a period to end if the purpose we collected it for no longer applies. We make no
    warranties your Personal Data will be available for any specific period (3 years, 10 years, or less or more, etc.).
    Please consider that we have no obligations to notify you when deleting your Personal Data or Personal Information
    and can do it at our sole discretion.
  </p>
  <p>
    It should be noted that you have certain rights in relation to your Personal Data or Personal Information. You may
    send us an email at
    &nbsp;
    <a href="mailto:privacy@3dlook.me">privacy@3dlook.me</a>
    &nbsp;
    in order to exercise any of your rights regarding your Personal Data or Personal Information (to request access to,
    correct, or delete any Personal Information or Personal Data that we have collected, or you have provided to us, to
    restrict or object processing).

  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that we cannot delete your Personal Information or Personal Data except by deleting your user account or
    profile (if any) as well. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would
    violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

  <h2>7. DATA SECURITY</h2>
  <p>
    We will maintain industry-standard physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect data in our
    possession from loss, misuse, any use not pointed in this Privacy Policy, and unauthorized access. Wherever we
    collect Personal Information or Personal Data, we make all commercially reasonable efforts to provide the necessary
    level of encryption, Anonymization (defined below), and/or Pseudonymization (defined below), as required by
    applicable law or regulation. All the data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use real-time logs and exceptions
    monitoring tools. We may provide such security measures using third parties (e.g., processors, contractors, etc.).
    For purposes of this Privacy Policy,
    &nbsp;
    <b>“Anonymization”</b>
    &nbsp;
    is defined as the processing of data with the aim of irreversibly preventing the identification of the individual to
    whom it relates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy,
    <b> “Pseudonymization”</b>
    &nbsp;
    is defined as replacing any identifying characteristics of data with a pseudonym, or, in other words, a value that
    does not allow the data subject to be directly identified.

  </p>
  <p>
    The safety and security of your information also depend on you. Do not disclose your contact information, password,
    or other data that allows or enables unauthorized access to the XpertFit, and keep this information confidential.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, no method of transmission or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Although we do our best to
    protect your Personal Information and Personal Data, we cannot guarantee that the data stored during your use of the
    XpertFit is invulnerable to hacking and will not be subject to a security breach. We make no warranty, guarantee, or
    representation that the XpertFit is or will be protected from all viruses, security threats, or other
    vulnerabilities or that your Personal Information or Personal Data, and other information, will always be secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Privacy Safeguards within the Company.</b>
    &nbsp;
    To ensure your Personal Information Personal Data is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to
    our staff and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the Company. Only employees who need your Personal
    Information or Personal Data to perform a specific job (e.g., customer service) are granted access to relevant
    personally identifiable information (Personal Data or Personal Data). All of our employees sign non-disclosure
    agreements (NDAs). Our security system is designed to ensure the possibility of identifying all the employees who
    had access/accessed Personal Information or Personal Data of our users.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Information Transferred to Third Parties.</b>
    &nbsp;
    Before transferring any Personal Information or Personal Data to a third party (processor, contractor, affiliate,
    partner, supplier, vendor, etc.), we shall make a reasonable check of such third party regarding its compliance with
    applicable laws or regulations.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Information Received from Third Parties.</b>
    &nbsp;
    In cases where we receive your Personal Information or Personal Data from a third party (i.e., controller of such
    data) during the fulfillment of contractual obligations, we act as a processor. In order to secure such Personal
    Data, we treat it with the same level of security as we treat Personal Data as if we collected it, as provided in
    this Privacy Policy (if applicable or if we are not obliged by the relevant contract to provide additional security
    measures). Additionally, we do not store such received Personal Data for a period longer than it is necessary to
    fulfill the relevant contract with a third party who provided us with your Personal Data.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Storage of Personal and Other Information; Consent for Storage Outside Your Country of Residence.</b>
    &nbsp;
    We will make commercially reasonable efforts to store the Personal Information or Personal Data of individuals in
    the regions where they live or operate in cases if we are required by law or regulation to do so. If storing
    Personal Information or Personal Data in such a way is not commercially reasonable, we will ensure that third
    parties who assist us with the storage of Personal Information or Personal Data (e.g., vendors, processors, etc.)
    are bound by an agreement that contains obligations of the third party to provide at least minimum necessary level
    of security and other provisions as required by law or regulation. Additionally, we will ensure that such an
    agreement contains the obligation of the third party to adopt necessary provisions into corresponding contracts with
    other third parties (e.g., sub-contractors, sub-processors, etc.), if any. By using the XpertFit, you give us your
    unambiguous consent to store your Personal Data (or information that does not identify you individually, if
    applicable) outside of your country of residence (registration, domicile, center of vital interests, economic
    region, etc.). You may request us to provide you with details concerning the safeguards employed by us to protect
    the Personal Information or Personal Data about you transferred to a third country by contacting us via e-mail at

  <h2>8. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

    We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time if doing so will be deemed necessary to comply with the
    applicable laws and current circumstances of the functioning of XpertFit or the technology, so please periodically

    You are responsible for periodically visiting this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.

    or Personal Information relating to the XpertFit users.

  <h2>3. SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>
    We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party for business purposes. When we disclose Personal
    Information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to
    keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. The CCPA
    prohibits third parties who purchase the Personal Information we hold from reselling it unless you have received
    explicit notice and an opportunity to opt-out of further sales.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Disclosures of Personal Information for a Bustiness Purpose.</b>
    &nbsp;
    For information about how we share your Personal Information with third parties (including disclosures made in the
    preceding 12 months), see the “DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION” section of our XpertFit Privacy Policy.

    <b>Sales of Personal Information.</b>
    &nbsp;
    We do not sell Personal Information.
  </p>
  <h2>4. YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES</h2>
  <p>
    The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This
    section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.

    </li>
    <li>
      If we sold or disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
      <ul>
        <li>
          sales, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
        </li>
        <li>
          disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of
          recipient obtained.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Deletion Request Rights.</b>

    retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see
    Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to
    delete) your Personal Information from our records unless an exception applies.

  </p>
  <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the Information is necessary for us or our service provider(s)
    to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you
      requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you,
      or otherwise perform our contract with you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute
      those responsible for such activities.

    <a href="mailto:privacy@3dlook.me">privacy@3dlook.me</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to
    your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The
    verifiable consumer request must:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected
      personal information or an authorized representative.
    </li>
    <li>
      Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it properly.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or
    authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
  </p>
  <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
  <p>
    We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity
    or authority to make the request.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Response Timing and Format.</b>
    &nbsp;
    We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require
    more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account
    with us, we will provide our written response by mail or electronically at your option.
  </p>

    16. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION. ARBITRATION, CLASS-ACTION WAIVER
  </h2>

  <p>
    PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU AND 3DLOOK Inc. TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL
    DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
  </p>

  <p>
    These Terms and other relationships between you and 3DLOOK shall be governed by the laws of the State of California,
    United States. All disputes and disagreements that might arise out of or in connection with these Terms shall be
    resolved through negotiations. You agree that for the settlement of disputes between you and 3DLOOK, e-mail
    correspondence with the authorized persons of 3DLOOK at

    <a href="mailto:legal@3dlook.me">legal@3dlook.me</a>

    shall be the effective and binding method of
    communication.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the Parties cannot agree on the subject of the dispute within thirty (30) days, you and 3DLOOK agree that all
    claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out
    of or relating to these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis.
  </p>

  <p>
    ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, OR THE XPERTFIT MUST BE
    COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS
    PERMANENTLY BARRED.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dispute shall be referred to and resolved by final and binding arbitration under the rules and auspices of the
    American Arbitration Association, to be held in San Mateo, California, in English, with a written decision stating
    legal reasoning issued by the arbitrator(s) at either party's request, and with arbitration costs and reasonable
    documented attorneys' costs of both parties to be borne by the party that ultimately loses. Either party may obtain
    injunctive relief (preliminary or permanent) and orders to compel arbitration or enforce arbitral awards in any
    court of competent jurisdiction.
  </p>

  <p>
    If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written
    submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the
    arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties
    mutually agree otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
    ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN
    INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
    LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. YOUR CONSENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES
    AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS
    ACTION.
  </p>

  <p>
    This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with 3DLOOK Inc.
  </p>

  <h2>
    17. WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY
  </h2>

  <p>
    No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or
    continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the
    Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
    provision.
  </p>

  <p>
    If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
    illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such
    that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.
  </p>

  <h2>
