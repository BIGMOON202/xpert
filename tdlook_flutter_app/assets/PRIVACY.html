  <h2>7. DATA SECURITY</h2>
  <p>
    We will maintain industry-standard physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect data in our
    possession from loss, misuse, any use not pointed in this Privacy Policy and unauthorized access. Wherever we collect
    Personal Information or Personal Data, we make all commercially reasonable efforts to provide the necessary level of
    encryption, Anonymization (defined below), and/or Pseudonymization (defined below), as required by applicable law or
    regulation. We may provide such security measures by using third parties (e.g., processors, contractors, etc.). For
    purposes of this Privacy Policy
    &nbsp;
    <b>“Anonymization”</b>
    &nbsp;
    are defined as the processing data with the aim of irreversibly
    preventing the identification of the individual to whom it relates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy or
    <b> “Pseudonymization”</b>
    &nbsp;
    are defined as replacing any identifying characteristics of data with a pseudonym, or, in other
    words, a value which does not allow the data subject to be directly identified.
  </p>
  <p>
    The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Do not to disclose your contact information, password,
    or other data that allows or enables unauthorized access to our Application(s), or Services, and keep this information
    confidential.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, no method of transmission or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Although we do our best to
    protect your Personal Information and Personal Data, we cannot guarantee that the data stored during your use of our
    Application(s) or Service(s) is invulnerable to hacking and will not be subject to a security breach. We make no warranty,
    guarantee, or representation that our Application(s) or Services are or will be protected from all viruses, security threats,
    or other vulnerabilities or that your Personal Information or Personal Data, and other information, will always be secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Privacy Safeguards within the Company.</b>
    &nbsp;
    To make sure your Personal Information Personal Data is secure, we
    communicate our privacy and security guidelines to our employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the
    Company. Only employees who need your Personal Information or Personal Data to perform a specific job (e.g. billing or
    customer service) are granted access to relevant personally identifiable information (Personal Data or Personal Data). All
    of our employees sign relevant non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and our security system is designed to ensure the
    possibility of identification of all the employees who had access/accessed Personal Information or Personal Data of our
    users.

  <p>
    <b>Information Transferred to Third Parties.</b>
    &nbsp;
    Before transferring any Personal Information or Personal Data to third party
    (processor, contractor, affiliate, partner, supplier, vendor, etc.) we shall make a reasonable check of such third party
    regarding its compliance with applicable laws or regulations.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Information Received from Third Parties.</b>
    &nbsp;
    In cases where we receive your Personal Information or Personal Data from
    a third-party (i.e., controller of such data) during the fulfillment of contractual obligations, we act as a processor. In order
    to secure such Personal Data, we treat it with the same level of security as we treat Personal Data as if it were collected
    by us, as provided in this Privacy Policy (if applicable or if we are not obliged by the relevant contract to provide

    additional security measures). Additionally, we do not store such received Personal Data for a period longer than it is
    necessary for the fulfillment of the relevant contract with a third party who provided us with your Personal Data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Storage of Personal and Other Information; Consent for Storage Outside Your Country of Residence.</b>
    &nbsp;
    We will
    make commercially reasonable efforts to store the Personal Information or Personal Data of individuals in the regions
    where they live or operate in cases if we are required by law or regulation to do so. If storing of Personal Information or
    Personal Data in such way is not commercially reasonable, we will ensure that third parties who assist us with the
    storage of Personal Information or Personal Data (e.g., vendors, processors, etc.) are bound by an agreement that
    contains obligations of the third party to provide at least minimum necessary level of security and other provisions as
    required by law or regulation. Additionally, we will ensure that such an agreement contains the obligation of the third
    party to adopt necessary provisions into his agreements with other third parties (e.g., sub-contractors, sub-processors,
    etc.), if any. By using our Application(s) or Services, you give us your unambiguous consent to store your Personal Data
    (or information that does not identify you individually, if applicable) outside of your country of residence (registration,
    domicile, centre of vital interests, economic region, etc.). You may request us to provide you with details concerning the
    safeguards employed by us to protect the Personal Information or Personal Data about you that is transferred to a third
    country, by contacting us via e-mail at

  <h2>3. SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>
    We may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose. When we disclose personal
    information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both
    keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. The CCPA
    prohibits third parties who purchase the personal information we hold from reselling it unless you have received explicit
    notice and an opportunity to opt-out of further sales.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Disclosures of Personal Information for a Bustiness Purpose.</b>
    &nbsp;

    &nbsp;
    You have the right to request that we disclose certain
    information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive

    disclose to you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>

        <li>
          sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
        </li>

          disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of
          recipient obtained.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Deletion Request Rights.</b>
    &nbsp;
    You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we
    collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer
    request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to
    delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
  </p>
  <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you
      requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or
      otherwise perform our contract with you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those
      responsible for such activities.
    </li>
    <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
    <li>
      Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise

    <li>
      Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to
      all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or
      seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship
      with us.
    </li>
    <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
    <li>
      Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided
      it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights. To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights
    described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by e-mailing us at
    &nbsp;
    <a href="mailto:privacy@3dlook.me">privacy@3dlook.me</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your

    personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The
    verifiable consumer request must:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected
      personal information or an authorized representative.
    </li>
    <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority
    to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
  </p>
  <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
  <p>
    We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or
    authority to make the request.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Response Timing and Format.</b>
    &nbsp;
    We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of
    its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with
    us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The
    response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability
    requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to
    transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically PDF format.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
    manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and
    provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
  </p>
  <h2>5. NON-DISCRIMINATION</h2>
  <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
    <li>
      Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or
      imposing penalties.
    </li>
